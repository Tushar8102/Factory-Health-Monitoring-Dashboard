# Factory Health Monitoring Dashboard
📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes factory device health data to identify locations and device types with the highest number of unhealthy machines. The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly detect operational risks and prioritize maintenance efforts.
The analysis is visualized using an interactive dashboard with two key perspectives:
Factory-wise unhealthy device count
Device-type-wise unhealthy device count
🛠 Tools & Technologies
Data Visualization Tool: Tableau
Dataset: Unified telemetry data from multiple Daikibo factories
Metrics Used: Device health status (Healthy vs Unhealthy)
📈 Dashboard Insights
🔹 Sheet 1: Unhealthy Devices by Factory
This chart compares the number of unhealthy devices across factories:
Daikibo Factory Seiko has the highest number of unhealthy devices, indicating a critical maintenance concern.
Daikibo Shenzhen also shows a significantly high count.
Daikibo Berlin has the lowest number of unhealthy devices, suggesting better operational health.
Insight: Maintenance and resource allocation should be prioritized for Seiko and Shenzhen factories.
🔹 Sheet 2: Unhealthy Devices by Device Type
This chart highlights unhealthy devices by category:
Laser Cutter devices contribute the largest share of unhealthy equipment.
Other device types such as CNC, Conveyor, and Spot Welding show comparatively low failure counts.
Insight: Laser Cutter machines may require closer monitoring, preventive maintenance, or replacement planning.
